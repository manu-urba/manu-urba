Welcome to my profile!<br/>

I've been interested in computer science ever since I was a kid: my passion for learning is insatiable, which is why Iâ€™ve taught myself many of the skills I possess. Iâ€™ve participated in IT events, including AWS Summit Milan 2022, CloudFest 2023. One of my strengths is my ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously. 
The most important skill I've learned as a software developer is the ability to easily break down complex problems into simple tasks and methodically work on them one by one. I believe this is fundamental for completing large projects and writing maintainable code.

```dart
class Manuel extends Person
{
  String name = "Manuel";
  String surname = "Urbano";
  DateTime birthDate = DateTime(2002, 8, 23);
  double age = DateTime.now().difference(birthDate).inDays / 365;
}
```
